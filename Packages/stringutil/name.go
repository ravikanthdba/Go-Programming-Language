// The above code is not executable, as it does not have a main function. Hence go run name.go would throw an exception. But this code can be compilable just to ensure that there are no syntactical errors. This code can be referenced in another Go program having main function. The variables used in this code can be referred in the main.go code.


// Any variable, starting with a Capital letter is the only one that can be exported. If the variable starts with a Lower case letter, then it cannot be exported.
